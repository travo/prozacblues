  %h1 Air guitar - Cool tech
  %p Yamaha have created another great travel guitar (dave has one of their fine creations already) and it's a real doozie!
  %p It comes with it's own internal digital pre-amp and processor, and breaks down nicely for your suitcase. Cool.
  %p
    No substitute for a good ol' Telecaster though, which doubles as an ironing board, cricket bat, stable table, chopping board...

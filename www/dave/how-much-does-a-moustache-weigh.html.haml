    How much does a
    %br
    Moustache Weigh?

  %p
    In 2007 I did Movember. I hated the whole moustache growing experience so much I vowed never to do it again. Between 2007 and 2013 I stacked on 10kg. After a while, I had the realisation that these two things might just be related.

  %blockquote.pull-quote Could my constant shaving have driven my moustache inwards?

    To test my theory I took part in Movember 2013, weighing myself before I started and then again at the end of Movember after I'd shaved off my newly grown mo'.

  %p
    During the moustache cultivation period I stimulated growth by:
    %ol
      %li Lifting heavy things (because that’s MANLY),
      %li Limiting my intake of substances that would stop me operating heavy machinery (because operating heavy machinery in MANLY)
      %li Ditching large lattes in favour of straight espresso (because that will put hair on your…lip)
      %li Eating less, as the body’s survival instinct is to stimulate moustache growth so that more crumbs can be caught and retained.
      %li Doing good things in the community (because that’s gentleMANLY!)

  %p
    Amazingly, after shaving I was 6kg lighter, adding empirical credence to my in-grown moustache theory.

  %p
    I intend to repeat the experiment this year, possibly with an expanded sample size.

  %p
    Please note that I do not recommend growing beyond one month as the extra weight on the front of the head may cause serious musculoskeletal issues in the neck.
